  afCryptographicallyWeak, // The system is not known to be cryptographically strong.
   // This flag is mutually exclusive with afStar. Not applicable to compressors and converters.
  afNotImplementedYet,  // The algorithm has not yet been implemented,

  afForTestOnly,   // For test purposes only. Do not use in a production system.
  afForRunTimeOnly,   // The selection will not be displayed as an option in the object inspector.

  afCompressor, // Only applies to Stream Ciphers. It means the intention
    // of the cipher is to compress or to expand data.
  afConverter, // Only applies to Stream Ciphers. It means the intention
    // of the cipher convert from one format to another, without
    // encryption nor the the main intention of compression.
  afBlockAdapter, // Only applies to Stream Ciphers. It means that the
    // stream cipher is an adapter for any applied block cipher.
  afDisplayNameOnKeySize,  // Normally if the display name includes %d
    // this is replaced by the block size in bits. However if the block

    //  by the key size in bits.
  afDoesNotNeedSalt, // Only applicable to IStreamCiphers which are true
    //  crytographic codecs, that is to say they do not have the
    //   afCompressor or afConverter feature. Normally, stream ciphers will
    //   be used by injecting a 64 bit salt of random data at the start
    //   of the plaintext stream. However, if the cipher has this feature
    //   (afDoesNotNeedSalt) it means it is already salting its own
    //   tranform, or it cannot benefit from salt. In this case, users of
    //   IStreamCipher, such as TCodec will not salt the plaintext.

{
Empty (any mode) ==> empty.

NoChaining modes (eg. ECB)
1. Pad: Add one byte $80 and then pad out with zeros.
2. Encrypt blocks without nonce.

Other mode
1. Make a nonce. The size of the nonce is 128 bits (16 bytes).
The nonce is to be a random number.
2. If the block size is greater or equal to 128 bits, then
set the lower 128 bits of the IV to be equal to the nounce,
and the higher bits zero.
3. If the block size is less than 128 bits, then set the
IV to be the lower (block size) bits of the nounce.
4. Emit in the clear the part of the nonce used to make the IV.
5. If nonce was bigger than block size, prepend the plaintext
with the balance of the nonce, before encryption.

If not a keystream (eg. CBC), and the prepended plaintext is less than
one block, then switch to OFB.

If not a keystream, but prepended plaintext is greater or equal
to one block then apply ciphertext srealing.

If keystream, then just clip the last partial ciphertext block.
